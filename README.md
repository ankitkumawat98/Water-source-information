# Water-source-information
There are many rivers in India but we do not know what they will be using in the work and we do not know what kind of water in rivers and in what purpose we can use it. There is no complete information about all those rivers. • A website will be created portal along with the complete database which will keep the information, the names of rivers, water quality, water usage type etc. It will also have an option to update the information which only high authority can change the data. • This website will be a RESPONSIVE which can use this site on a smartphone too.
